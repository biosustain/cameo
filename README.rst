What is Cameo?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Cameo** is a high-level python library developed to aid the strain
design process in metabolic engineering projects. The library provides a
modular framework of simulation methods, strain design methods, access
to models, that targets developers that want custom analysis workflows.

Computationally heavy methods have been parallelized and can be run on a
clusters using the IPython parallelization framework (see example and
documentation for more details). The default fallback is python's
multiprocessing library.

Furthermore, it exposes a high-level API to users that just want to
compute promising strain designs.

You got curious? Head over to `try.cameo.bio <http://try.cameo.bio>`__
and give it a try.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use pip to install Cameo from
`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cameo>`__ (we recommend doing this
inside a `virtual
environment <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`__).

::

    pip install cameo

We highly recommend updating ``pip`` beforehand
(``pip install pip --upgrade``).

In case you downloaded the source code, run

::

    pip install -e .  # recommended

while you are in the top level directory. You might need to run these
commands with administrative privileges if you're not using a virtual
environment (using ``sudo`` for example).

Examples
~~~~~~~~

A number of examples are available as static
(`nbviewer.ipython.org <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/biosustain/cameo-notebooks/tree/master/>`__)
or executable Jupyter (née IPython) notebooks
(`try.cameo.bio <http://try.cameo.bio>`__).

High-level API (for users)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Compute strain engineering strategies for a desired product in a number
of host organisms using the high-level interface.

::

    from cameo.api import design
    design(product='L-Serine')

`Output <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/biosustain/cameo-notebooks/blob/master/8-high-level-API.ipynb>`__


Command Line Interface (for users)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The API can be called directly from the command line.
For more information about how to run it, open your terminal and run:

::

   cameo --helo

Low-level API (for developers)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Find gene knockout targets using evolutionary computation.

::

    from cameo import models
    from cameo.strain_design.heuristic import GeneKnockoutOptimization
    from cameo.strain_design.heuristic.objective_functions import biomass_product_coupled_yield

    model = models.bigg.e_coli_core
    obj = biomass_product_coupled_yield(
        model.reactions.Biomass_Ecoli_core_w_GAM,
        model.reactions.EX_succ_e,
        model.reactions.EX_glc_e)
    ko = GeneKnockoutOptimization(model=model, objective_function=obj)
    ko.run(max_evaluations=50000, n=1, mutation_rate=0.15, indel_rate=0.185)

`Output <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/biosustain/cameo-notebooks/blob/master/6-predict-gene-knockout-strategies.ipynb>`__

Predict heterologous pathways for a desired chemical.

::

    from cameo.strain_design import pathway_prediction
    predictor = pathway_prediction.PathwayPredictor(model)
    pathways = predictor.run(product="vanillin")

`Output <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/biosustain/cameo-notebooks/blob/master/7-predict-heterologous-pathways.ipynb>`__

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This library depends on:

-  `cobrapy <https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy>`__ for
   constraint-based modeling
-  `optlang <https://github.com/biosustain/optlang>`__ for heuristic
   optimization and mathematical programming

Furthermore, the following dependencies are needed:

-  `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`__ and
   `scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`__ for obvious reasons.
-  `IPython <http://ipython.org/>`__ is needed for parallel computations
   and notebook interface.
-  `bokeh <http://bokeh.pydata.org/>`__ is needed for reporting progress
   and plotting in the IPython notebook interface.
-  `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__ is needed because most
   functions returns results as pandas DataFrames.
-  `inspyred <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/inspyred>`__ for evolutionary
   computations.
