What is cameo?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Cameo** is a high-level python library developed to aid the strain
design process in metabolic engineering projects. The library provides a
modular framework of simulation and strain design methods that targets
developers that want to develop new design algorithms and custom analysis workflows.
Furthermore, it exposes a high-level API to users that just want to
compute promising strain designs.

Curious? Head over to `try.cameo.bio <http://try.cameo.bio>`__
and give it a try.

Please cite https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00423 if you've used cameo in a scientific publication.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. installation-start

Use pip to install cameo from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cameo>`__.

::

    $ pip install cameo


In case you downloaded or cloned the source code from `GitHub <https://github.com/biosustain/cameo>`__
or your own fork, you can run the following to install cameo for development.

::

    $ pip install -e <path-to-cameo-repo>  # recommended


You might need to run these commands with administrative
privileges if you're not using a virtual environment (using ``sudo`` for example).
Please check the `documentation <http://cameo.bio/installation.html>`__
for further details.

Documentation and Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Documentation is available on `cameo.bio <http://cameo.bio>`__. Numerous `Jupyter notebooks <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/biosustain/cameo-notebooks/tree/master/>`__
provide examples and tutorials and also form part of the documentation. They are also availabe in executable form on (`try.cameo.bio <http://try.cameo.bio>`__).
Furthermore, course materials for a two day cell factory engineering course are available `here <https://biosustain.github.io/cell-factory-design-course/>`__.

High-level API (for users)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Compute strain engineering strategies for a desired product in a number
of host organisms using the high-level interface (runtime is on the order of hours).

::

    from cameo.api import design
    design(product='L-Serine')

`Output <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/biosustain/cameo-notebooks/blob/master/08-high-level-API.ipynb>`__


The high-level API can also be called from the command line.

::

    $ cameo design vanillin

For more information run

::

    $ cameo --help

Low-level API (for developers)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Find gene knockout targets using evolutionary computation.

::

    from cameo import models
    from cameo.strain_design.heuristic import GeneKnockoutOptimization
    from cameo.strain_design.heuristic.objective_functions import biomass_product_coupled_yield

    model = models.bigg.e_coli_core
    obj = biomass_product_coupled_yield(
        model.reactions.Biomass_Ecoli_core_w_GAM,
        model.reactions.EX_succ_e,
        model.reactions.EX_glc_e)
    ko = GeneKnockoutOptimization(model=model, objective_function=obj)
    ko.run(max_evaluations=50000, n=1, mutation_rate=0.15, indel_rate=0.185)

`Output <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/biosustain/cameo-notebooks/blob/master/05-predict-gene-knockout-strategies.ipynb>`__

Predict heterologous pathways for a desired chemical.

::

    from cameo.strain_design import pathway_prediction
    predictor = pathway_prediction.PathwayPredictor(model)
    pathways = predictor.run(product="vanillin")

`Output <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/biosustain/cameo-notebooks/blob/master/07-predict-heterologous-pathways.ipynb>`__
