**Cameo** is a high-level python library developed to aid the strain
design process in metabolic engineering projects. The library provides a
modular framework of simulation methods, strain design methods, and access
to models, that targets developers that want custom analysis workflows.
Furthermore, it exposes a high-level API to users that just want to
compute promising strain designs.
