**Cameo** is a high-level python library developed to aid the strain
design process in metabolic engineering projects. The library provides a
modular framework of simulation methods, strain design methods, access
to models, that targets developers that want custom analysis workflows.

Computationally heavy methods have been parallelized and can be run on a
clusters using the IPython parallelization framework (see example and
documentation for more details). The default fallback is python's
multiprocessing library.

Furthermore, it exposes a high-level API to users that just want to compute
promising strain designs.

    from cameo.api import design
    design(product='L-Serine')
