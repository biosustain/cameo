class MultiprocessingMigrator(object):
    """Migrate among processes on multiple machines. This is possible by
    having a Queue implemented on redis.

    This callable class allows individuals to migrate from one process
    to another. It maintains a queue of migrants whose maximum length
    can be fixed via the ``max_migrants`` parameter in the constructor.
    If the number of migrants in the queue reaches this value, new migrants
    are not added until earlier ones are consumed. The unreliability of a
    multiprocessing environment makes it difficult to provide guarantees.
    However, migrants are theoretically added and consumed at the same rate,
    so this value should determine the "freshness" of individuals, where
    smaller queue sizes provide more recency.

    An optional keyword argument in ``args`` requires the migrant to be
    evaluated by the current evolutionary computation before being inserted
    into the population. This can be important when different populations
    use different evaluation functions and you need to be able to compare
    "apples with apples," so to speak.

    The migration takes the current individual *I* out of the queue, if
    one exists. It then randomly chooses an individual *E* from the population
    to insert into the queue. Finally, if *I* exists, it replaces *E* in the
    population (re-evaluating fitness if necessary). Otherwise, *E* remains in
    the population and also exists in the queue as a migrant.

    Optional keyword arguments in args:

    - *evaluate_migrant* -- should new migrants be evaluated before
      adding them to the population (default False)

    max_migrants: int
